For most of the queries customerid=0 is removed

2). How often are purchases made by repeat customers vs new customers? What is the frequency of the purchases of each group? (how often orders come in)

Mostly repeat customers are ordering everyday from 10/4/2009 to 9/16/2016, according to the data

SELECT c.orderdate, COUNT(*) AS order_counts FROM (
SELECT o.customerid, ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY o.customerid, ol.orderid ORDER BY o.numunits) AS ROW_NUM
FROM orders AS o
INNER JOIN orderlines AS ol ON o.orderid = ol.orderid
WHERE customerid != 0)A
INNER JOIN orders C ON A.customerid = C.customerid
WHERE A.ROW_NUM > 1
GROUP BY c.orderdate
ORDER BY c.orderdate

Mostly new customers are also ordering everyday from 10/4/2009 to 9/16/2016, according to the data

SELECT o.orderdate, COUNT(*) AS order_counts FROM orders AS o INNER JOIN
(SELECT DISTINCT customerid FROM (
SELECT o.customerid, ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY o.customerid, ol.orderid ORDER BY o.numunits) AS ROW_NUM
FROM orders AS o
INNER JOIN orderlines AS ol ON o.orderid = ol.orderid
WHERE customerid != 0)A
WHERE A.ROW_NUM = 1
EXCEPT
SELECT customerid FROM (
SELECT o.customerid, ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY o.customerid, ol.orderid ORDER BY o.numunits) AS ROW_NUM
FROM orders AS o
INNER JOIN orderlines AS ol ON o.orderid = ol.orderid
WHERE customerid != 0)B
WHERE B.ROW_NUM > 1) AS c ON o.customerid = c.customerid
GROUP BY o.orderdate
ORDER BY o.orderdate

3). What do new customers usually purchase?
New customers usually purchase books, with top 5 products are books with product id 11168, 11009, 12139, 12510,11088
with counts 7912, 5266, 3895, 3826,2779 respectively

query

SELECT N.productid,p.name, p.groupname, counts FROM
(SELECT ol.productid, COUNT(1) AS counts FROM orders AS o INNER JOIN
(SELECT DISTINCT customerid FROM (
SELECT o.customerid, ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY o.customerid, ol.orderid ORDER BY o.numunits) AS ROW_NUM
FROM orders AS o
INNER JOIN orderlines AS ol ON o.orderid = ol.orderid
WHERE customerid != 0)A
WHERE A.ROW_NUM = 1
EXCEPT

WHERE B.ROW_NUM > 1) AS c ON o.customerid = c.customerid
INNER JOIN orderlines ol on o.orderid = ol.orderid
GROUP BY ol.productid
ORDER BY counts DESC)N INNER JOIN products AS p ON N.productid = p.productid

4). What do repeat customers usually purchase (same items or different items)?

21229 repeat customers buying repeated same items
31193 Repeated customers who buy different items.

5). How many items do customers purchase in one order? How many items do customers purchase in all their orders combined?
Answer: Not sure of whether avg is asked for partj

part 1: number of items for each order are listed with below query

SELECT o.customerid, ol.orderid, SUM(ol.numunits) AS NoOfItems
FROM orders AS o
INNER JOIN orderlines AS ol ON o.orderid = ol.orderid
WHERE customerid !=0
GROUP BY o.customerid, ol.orderid

Total query runtime: 32 secs.
189559 rows retrieved.

part 2: total number of items of each customer is listed

SELECT o.customerid, SUM(ol.numunits) AS NoOfItems
FROM orders AS o
INNER JOIN orderlines AS ol ON o.orderid = ol.orderid
WHERE customerid !=0
GROUP BY o.customerid
Total query runtime: 22 secs.
189559 rows retrieved.

6). Have all customers made purchases? How many are one time buyers vs repeat buyers?

Answer: All the customers made atleast one purchase, 52422 are repeat customers and 137137 are one time buyers

SELECT c.customerid
FROM customers AS c LEFT OUTER JOIN orders AS o on c.customerid = o.customerid
WHERE o.customerid != NULL

part2
SELECT DISTINCT customerid FROM (
SELECT o.customerid, ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY o.customerid, ol.orderid ORDER BY o.numunits) AS ROW_NUM
FROM orders AS o
INNER JOIN orderlines AS ol ON o.orderid = ol.orderid
WHERE customerid != 0)A
WHERE A.ROW_NUM > 1
Total query runtime: 5 secs.
52422 rows retrieved.

52422 are repeat customers

SELECT DISTINCT customerid FROM (
SELECT o.customerid, ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY o.customerid, ol.orderid ORDER BY o.numunits) AS ROW_NUM
FROM orders AS o
INNER JOIN orderlines AS ol ON o.orderid = ol.orderid
WHERE customerid != 0)A
WHERE A.ROW_NUM = 1
EXCEPT
SELECT customerid FROM (
SELECT o.customerid, ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY o.customerid, ol.orderid ORDER BY o.numunits) AS ROW_NUM
FROM orders AS o
INNER JOIN orderlines AS ol ON o.orderid = ol.orderid
WHERE customerid != 0)B
WHERE B.ROW_NUM > 1

Total query runtime: 14 secs.
137137 rows retrieved.

137137 are the one time customers
