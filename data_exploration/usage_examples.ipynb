The United States of America owes them and their families the highest honors.This is an amazing story of the extremes people can endure in the struggle to survive. While the story focuses on the life of Louis Zamperini, there are other men and women in the cast, and I found it interesting to see what motivated them to survive.Without including spoilers, I will mention the book has a Christian theme to it, and one should realize this going in because it plays a vital role in the \"redemption\" mentioned in the subtitle. I found this to be an encouraging story that touched on God\\'s providence, and the comfort He can bring to our troubled lives. I highly recommend the story to people struggling under heavy burdens because I finished the story being both encouraged and stronger in faith.The only reason I didn\\'t give the book five stars is because I thought the ending was a little weak. It seemed to peter out rather than coming to a strong conclusion about Louis\\' life and his will to remain unbroken. The ending was OK, but it left me wanting a little more closure and/or reflections from Louis life.', 2, '\"Ah, you\\'re the boy with the fast finish.\"Laura Hillenbrand\\'s Unbroken amazingly describes and follows Louis Zamperini\\'s mischievous youth to the Japanese POW camp where he is interned after being shot down over the Pacific on a rescue mission. There he is constantly tortured, beaten, and psychologically driven to the very edge by the likes of Mutshuiro Watanabe (a.k.a `The Bird\\' by prison inmates.) This World War II story takes place between Louis childhood, through to his exploits at the 1936 Berlin Olympics, and finally to his internment at the Japanese POW camp Ofuna.Louis Zamperini grew up in the town of Torrance, California, and was often the instigator of mischiefs that included robbing and trespassing. He began smoking at age five, picking up fading cigarette butts on the sidewalks on his way to kindergarten. Louis was the son of Italian immigrants and was born in Olean, New York before moving to Torrance. His parents were very hard-working and showed him the value of merit. Frequently telling stories about how his mischievous plans unfolded to his friends, his stories often ended with; \"... and then I ran like mad.\" By the end of his high school track career, he became a world class runner. He set a high school national record for one mile. Louis then qualified for his bout at the 1936 Olympics by tying the world record holder in a five thousand meter run. At the Olympics for the five thousand meter run, Louis was recognized by Adolf Hitler for being \"the boy with the fast finish.\"--for completing the final lap in only fifty-six seconds. Louis enrolled in the University of South California before becoming a U.S. Air Corps Bombardier in the South Pacific. Little did Louis know that he would face a whole new world of hell on earth that involved throwing his own crewmate overboard after considering cannibalism, to dealing with the various physical and psychological torments of \"The Bird.\"Hillenbrand\\'s ability to tell this story which such a sense of an embellishing novel is astounding. The book deals with something almost everyone can relate to: strength, perseverance, determination, and downright luck. Hillenbrand also does a fantastic job at portraying the life of POWs--after all she got a firsthand account from Mr. Zamperini himself at age nighty-three, and is still `Unbroken\\' so to say. The most memorable part of Hillenbrand\\'s story telling ability came when describing how \"The Bird\" has penetrated deep into his innermost thoughts: \"Louie was suddenly screaming. Sylvia turned and found him shaking violently, shouting; \"Take it off! Take it off! I can\\'t stand it!\" As Sylvia jumped up, Louie swore at the voice, yelling something about propaganda prisoners. Sylvia snatched up the record, and Louie yelled at her to break it. She smashed it and threw it away. Louie fell silent, shivering. His family stared at him in horror. Louie walked upstairs and lay down on his old bed. When he finally drifted off, the Bird followed him into his dreams.\" This is one of only many brilliant examples where Hillenbrand is able to convey the message across so precisely.This non-fiction narrative really stands out in all the others I have read. I highly recommend it for the amazing work Hillenbrand put into her novel. With great enthusiasm, I hope you choose to read this truly moving story.', 1, '\"Seabiscuit\" and \"Unbroken\" - I will now read anything Laura Hillenbrand ever writes. It just doesn\\'t get any better than this. True stories are always the best and the most inspiring.', 1, '\"The paradox of vengefulness is that it makes men dependent upon those who have harmed them, believing that their release from pain will come only when they make their tormentors suffer.\"The story of Louis\\' conversion and life since conversion left me wanting to know more about his story. Conversely, the story of his life in the POW camps and on the raft were FULL of details that made me hurt for him and understand his hatred for his captors.I recommend this book and urge readers to consider Jesus Christ, personifying the antithesis to vengefulness, who, hanging on the cross, asked His Father to forgive those who were tormenting and crucifying Him. May we see such a desire to forgive our enemies as our Savior did and as Louis Zamperini was able to do.', 1, '\"Unbroken  A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption\" is a great book that tells the story of Louie Zamperini. During WWII we fought for freedom. However the publisher of this book discriminates against blind and dyslexic people by not enabling the text-to-speech option. Thus, denying a large number of people access to this book. If you care about fairness and want to keep good literature alive, please pressure the Random House to enable text-to-speech. Also, please ask Amazon to seek fairness from the the publishing houses they deal with. Why would anyone want to limit the freedom of people to enjoy good literature?', 1, '\"Unbroken\" by Laura Hillenbrand has got to be ONE of the very best books out there today. Her descriptive powers not only lures you in but leaves you there, staggered and vacariously broken, at the edge of humanity, insofar as the saga and heroism of this one man, Louis Zamperini, can bring you. What an unbeliveable man, a hero many times over, and surely a name I would not forget as long as I live. Great story-telling on Hillenbrand\\'s part to bring alive a forgotten piece of history and personal sacrifice no exquisite film studio can possibly manifest. ~ Cullen Dorn - author of \"The Hierophant Of 100th Street\"', 1, '\"Unbroken\" by Laura Hillenbrand is the amazing non-fiction story of Loius Zamperini and American athlete, World War II Air Corp bombardier who survived a crash and interment in a Japanese POW camp.The book is divided into five parts:Part I - where we meet the juvenile delinquent Louis Zamperini and his family. Always getting in trouble for breaking & entering, fighting and stealing, Louis finally finds his calling on the track and becomes a prodigy in short distance running.Part II - After a commanding performance in the Berlin Olympics, Louis\\' dreams of a medal get tarnished with the events leading to World War II. The athlete becomes an airman. Louis\\' crew mates and buddies train for bombing missions on their B-24 and even have several successful runs. Feeling lucky to be alive they rejoice everyday until they are forced to go on a rescue mission (the plane they were given was not air worthy) and crash into the Pacific.Part III - Adrift at sea Louie\\', Phil and Mac survive and astounding 47 fighting sharks, hunger, thirst, heat and cold. They drift 2,000 miles only to become POWs.Part IV - The survives are sent to the dreadful island of Kwajalein, known as \"Execution Island\" and unexpectedly sent to Yokohama, a POW camp.  Louie meets his share of sadistic POW guards, disease, starvation and slave labor.  However the stubborn man lives through the ordeal to the end of the war, all the way home.Part V - Louie\\'s home, but the war leaves its scars, both physical and emotional.Epilogue - What happened to the those mentioned in the story.  A wrap up.Acknowledgment- well worth reading. The author tells of her research, interviews and more.Notes - Certainly worth a glance.\"Unbroken\" by Laura Hillenbrand is a gripping, well written and diligently researched book.  It is hard to decide what\\'s more amazing, Louis Zamperini\\'s story or Ms. Hillenbrand\\'s telling of it.OK, Mr. Zamperini wins - but by a small margin.The story is amazing, but the prose is brilliant.  Ms. Hillenbrand uses a straightforward narrative without testing the reader\\'s knowledge of the English language.  Each sentence is plain, clear and understandable, which to me only shows that it was labored on rigorously.  The account is so descriptive one can almost feel themselves floating in the shark infest waters for a 1,000 miles with Zamperini and his friends.But \"Unbroken\" is not only the story of Zamperini, but also of World War II from the vantage point a POW who was uncertain when the sun rose, whether he\\'ll get to see it set again.  The confusi0n which the men felt during their time as POWs only expatiated after the war, when they realized the political games being played by the world\\'s leader at their expense.', 1, '\"Unbroken\" by Laura Hillenbrand may be the most informative WWII history that I have ever read, amazing research. I think it should be required reading for any American that thinks they or their ancestors were badly mistreated or taken advantage of in the past, with exception of the native American Indians. Three of my Book club members has read the book and agree with me. It will be on our 2014 list for the remainder to read and we should have an educational discussion. I purchased my book from amazon for my kindle in 2011 and I regret waiting until 2013 to read it. Amazon has this book on today\\'s special buy again.', 1, '\"Unbroken\" deserves the acclaim it has received.  It is the story of Louis Zamperini and his extraordinary tale of survival during World War II.  Zamperini grew up a juvenile delinquent in Torrance, CA.  At the urging of his older brother, Zamperini learned to channel his energy into running.  He quickly became a legend in southern California, shattering the high-school record for the mile and eventually becoming a member of the 1936 Olympic team.  Louie was training for the Tokyo Olympics in 1940 when the games were canceled because of the war.  Louie joined the Army Air Corp and became a bombardier on a B-24 in the Pacific theater.  While on a search and rescue mission, the plane he\\'s on crashes into the Pacific.  The survivors cling to two tiny rafts for 47 days.Two of the men survive this ordeal, only to be captured by the Japanese and sent to the first of several prison-of-war camps.  His celebrity makes Zamperini the focus of terrible assaults and cruelty, especially by a horribly sadistic guard nicknamed \"the Bird.\"  The cruelty of the Japanese during the war has largely been forgotten, but this account serves to help us not forget the suffering and humiliation these men endured.Ms. Hillenbrand is an amazing storyteller.  Moreover, she has done an incredible job of research.  She also does a great job of describing the incredible dangers of aviation during World War II and what it\\'s like to be a member of the flight crew on a B-24 bomber.  In the end, \"Unbroken\" is an incredibly gripping tale and a compelling story.  It is unforgettable, gripping, unnerving, and inspiring.The three primary criticisms of the tiny minority who dislike this book are all without merit: 1)  One criticism is that the book stretches the truth.  In my opinion, the critics would have rightfully criticized it as too over the top if it were a work of fiction, but this story didn\\'t need embellishment.  2) Another criticism is that the writing is mundane.  Hogwash! 3) The final criticism is that the suffering in the book goes on and on and one.  Again, if this were fiction, that would be a legitimate criticism.  But this is real life, and this is what Zamperini and many men went through.', 1, '\"Unbroken\" is a living history time with which we are lucky enough to be able to read from the person that had to live it. Thank you Louis we will never forget.', 1, '\"Unbroken\" is a riveting account of a man\\'s journey through rescue against all odds, redemption through the saving power of Jesus, and then reconciliation with his former enemies.  The book touched me on several levels.My father was in his bunk reading the Sunday paper when the first of six torpedoes hit his ship, the USS West Virginia, during the Japanese attack against Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941.  By the time he got up on deck, the ship\\'s captain was dead, the ship was sinking, and the order to abandon ship had been given.  Dad swam through water covered with burning bunker fuel to Ford Island.  He was transferred to a destroyer, the USS Patterson, on which he fought for most of the rest of the war.  Like many WWII veterans, Dad never talked about his wartime experiences or his feelings about the Japanese, but he never bought anything made in Japan.As a Vietnam veteran, I felt that I did not harbor ill-will against the North Vietnamese following the war.  In fact, while attending the Indian National Defence (British spelling) College as a colonel in 1993, I became a close friend with a Vietnamese colonel who had also fought in the war.  Later, however, when I was the defense attach&eacute; in New Delhi, I met a Vietnamese officer who informed me that he had been an interrogator in the Hanoi Hilton.  Perhaps it was his perceived smirk, but I had to strenuously resist the urge to do bodily harm to him.  Louis Zamperini, on the other hand, demonstrated true Christian forgiveness when he met his former tormentors.This book is a must read for anyone interested in WWII and those seeking a great story about survival against all odds.', 1, '\"Unbroken\" is a story of triumph of the human spirit.  Ms. Hillenbrand\\'s narrative of Mr. Zamperini\\'s life was funny, heartbreaking and yet inspiring.  I was amazed at how well she told his story to the point that I cringed and laughed at his youthful rebellion, agonized for him while lost at sea and felt every struggling minute of his time in the Japanese Prisioner of war camps. How does one survive something that horrendous?  The best part was reading about his finding the Lord which was the salvation of his marriage and his ultimate forgiveness to the Japanese.  Only Christ brings meaning to our lives as she portrayed so well in this book.  I would recommend \"Unbroken\" to anyone going through tough times in their life.', 1, '\"Unbroken\" is a true story--a bit wordy in parts and a bit gory when describing atrocities done to POWs, but an excellent read that I highly recommend.  Ms. Hildebrand makes you feel as though you are right there.  I was very young when WWII occurred, and must admit I felt it all \"far away from me\" as our family didn\\'t have any close relatives in the war.  Therefore, I learned a lot from this book and consider it a \"Must Read.\"', 1, '\"Unbroken\" is a very readable, well-researched non-fiction book that is a real \"Kindle\" page-turner.  It is engrossing, detailed, and extremely interesting.', 1, '\"Unbroken\" is a wonderful book, studiously researched and evocatively written. Props to Laura for an excellent, wide-ranging, outside-looking-in retelling of Louie\\'s life. Given her illness, Laura is herself heroic. Many congratulations to her on her book\\'s success.For those also interested in the first person version, please seek out Louie\\'s autobiography, \"Devil at My Heels: A WWII Hero\\'s Epic Saga of Torment, Survival, and Forgiveness,\" published in 2003. (A very different version was originally written in 1957, but is long out of print and missing much. The current softcover has the same title, but a different subtitle.)Full disclosure: I helped Louie write \"Devil at My Heels\" after his late wife, Cynthia Applewhite -- a long-time friend -- called me to suggest that I watch  Louie\\'s story on \"48 Hours.\" She said the call was \"accidental,\" but knowing Cynthia, I suspect she was up to something. I watched. I called her immediately and asked about Louie doing a book. He\\'d simultaneously been contacted by an agent. Cynthia put us all together. I knew of Louie, of course, but actually working with him for two years -- and remaining friends ever since -- has immeasurably enhanced my life, then and now.Taken together these two books tell an unforgettable story.', 1, '\"Unbroken\" is an amazing story.  The book read quickly and I didn\\'t want to put it down.  The story of Louie Zamporini is so unbelievable that it is hard to believe this book is nonfiction. It is wonderfully written and full of interesting history.  I\\'ve come away with an amazing respect for Mr. Zamporini and POWs.  A must read for those interested in this genre.  You won\\'t be disappointed.', 1, '\"Unbroken\" is breathtaking and heartbreaking.  It takes war out of the John Wayne realm and tells us the true story of what heroism really is. Underequipped, undertrained, and terribly young, these young Americans were sent out with odds against them. They more than rose to the occasion and \"Unbroken\" takes you on their horrific journey. This book will make you cry, cheer, and just cause your blood to boil. At times, I had to stop reading because I was overwhelmed mentally and emotionally. It\\'s strong stuff. If you only read one book this year, make this the book. If you\\'ve given short-shift to the price of freedom, read this book. If you don\\'t truly know the feeling of pride, read this book. You will never forget these men, their story, or their sacrifices.', 1, '\"Unbroken\" is exceptionally well written and very well documented.  This is a fascinating book to read and honors many servicemen who lived through this horrendous experience even though the focus is on one man, Louis Zamparini.  I have read this book twice and will no doubt read it many more times.  I recently read that Ron Howard is going to make a movie based on \"Unbroken\", and will look forward to seeing it.I noticed this book on Amazon when I was searching for a true story that happened in WWII.  It was presented in a special offering and I unknowingly bought a book that I will never forget.', 1, '\"Unbroken\" is one of the best books I have ever read.  \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" has always been my #1 favorite, and \"Unbroken\" ranks right up there.  I didn\\'t want to put this book down....I was so drawn into the story and my emotions were all over the place....I cried, I laughed, my heart ached, and I felt intense anger as I read of Louie\\'s time in the POW camps.  I hope this book is made into a movie soon!!  I have recommended on my Facebook page for all my friends and family to read it.  I can\\'t wait to hear their reviews.  Buy this book and you will see what I\\'m talking about.', 1, '\"Unbroken\" is one of the better books I have read in years! I have passed it on to my husband, brother and cousin by means of purchasing copies for them on Amazon.', 1, '\"Unbroken\" is one of those stories you hear about and immediately think \"no way can this be true.  No one could have had all those things happen to him and live to tell about it\".But then you realize it is true; that all those things did happen and he did live to tell about it!  Louis Zamperini is truly a special man, whose will to survive knew no bounds.What he and the other troops went through in the South Pacific war boggles the mind and makes the reader realize, if they didn\\'t already, what a huge debt we owe to those incredibly braveand heroic men and women who fought for us in WWII.A great amount of gratitude and respect for her talent must go to the author,Laura Hillenbrand, for a beautifully written book that captures your interest and attention, page after page.That she wanted to be accurate and factual in putting this book together, is evidenced by the pages of notes, which themselves make a small book.  As an aside, I find it remarkable thatshe was able to write the wonderful, true story of \"Seabiscuit\" and then capture Louis\\' amazing journey to hell and back.', 1, '\"Unbroken\" is our book club selection this month, and I\\'m awfully glad it was, because I\\'m not usually drawn to \"World War II\" books, and I would have hated to miss this fantastic story of a man who starts out life at a disadvantage (frequent pneumonia, and a predilection for getting into mischief) and continues to be knocked down and challenged throughout his life--but who Keeps. Getting. Up. Again. Louis Zamperini is truly the embodiment of the phrase, \"Greatest Generation,\" and we can all learn a great deal from his courage and strength.What I loved: Lauren Hillenbrand\\'s writing. She is so humble, she writes the story and gets the heck out of the way of it. There are no extraneous, show-offy words (like \"extraneous\" for instance, ha ha). She\\'s like a superb and sensitive and observant reporter, as she tells the story and lets the facts speak for themselves. She\\'s so skillful that during the plane crash scenes, and the stranded-at-sea scenes, including the shark attacks, one reads and feels as if they are SEEING those events.I also loved her obvious love for this man, her affection and admiration for him shined.I loved her acknowledgments, sharing the credit for her SEVEN YEARS of work researching and writing this wonderful book with those who helped her.What I didn\\'t love: I thought the concentration camp/Japanese prison section was too long. If Lauren\\'s goal was to make the reader feel a little bit like Louie must have felt in that prison camp--like it was going on and on and might never end--she kind of succeeded.If I hadn\\'t been reading it for book club I might have bailed on the book at that point, because I\\'m a rather undisciplined reader. I\\'m SO glad I didn\\'t bail, because I would have missed Louie\\'s glorious epiphanies and how he changed his life, later in life.What I didn\\'t love: This is almost a quibble, but: after all those pages and pages spent on the raft and then especially in the concentration camp, I was kind of rocked by how quickly the author handled Louie\\'s epiphany. She spends many pages detailing his descent into depression and alcoholism and rage, but then in what seems like a few paragraphs, boom! He hears Billy Graham and he never has another nightmare and never touches another drink. I believe it is the truth, but it was just treated so quickly and without any detail by an author who meticulously and at great length detailed the other four major sections of his life: childhood, the Army, being lost at sea, and the prison camps.Recommendation: Absolutely, positively, two thumbs way up. Loved this book and will recommend it to everyone.', 1, '\"Unbroken\" is the almost incredible story of Louis Zamperini, Olympian, Air Force Veteran, prisoner of war and inspirational speaker.  Normally I tell a lot of the facts of a history or biography, but this book reads so much like a novel that I want you to have the thrill of suspense that I did.To give you a few details, Zamperini grew up in California, became an Olympic runner who was expected to medal at the 1940 Tokyo Summer Olympics that were cancelled due to World War II.  Joining the Army Air Force, Zamperini was shot down over the Pacific, floated in a raft for 47 days after which they were captured by Japanese.  Author Laura Hillenbrand tells of the unspeakable cruelties inflicted on the prisoners until their liberation by Allied Forces.  Upon return to the States Zamperini struggled from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder until, well I better stop here.Suffice it to say, \"Unbroken\" is a well written tale of courage that truly could not be broken.  It tells a of a tragedy of war that is often overlooked, the sufferings of the POW.  Whether you are student of World War II or just looking for an inspiration \"Unbroken\" is the choice for you.', 1, '\"Unbroken\" is the story of a WWII AAF bombardier, Louis Zamparini.  The story begins when he is a child in California, but moves quickly to WWII and his life as a member of the US Army Air Corps.  I have a fascination with the men and women who saved our freedom on both the European and Pacific fronts.  I\\'ve always known that life during that period of time was tough for anyone who left the American shore.  My own uncle was a POW in Germany and it wasn\\'t until a few years ago that we learned what a hero he was when he saved the life of another POW who was seriously injured.  After reading this book, I realize that anyone who flew the bombers during WWII were heroes just for surviving their daily lives.  Due to the nature of the planes more personnel were killed in training flights than in actual combat.  That doesn\\'t lesson the horrors of combat.  The odds were totally against the American flyer.  Not only does Louie survive combat, but goes on to become a POW in Japan, a country that never ratified the terms of the Geneva Convention!  The details of \"camp life\" are enough to make one cry.  The cruelty of the guards, the viciousness of the discipline, the lack of food, and the slave labor  makes one wonder how anyone could have survived.  While I have not finished reading this book, I can honestly say that it is a fascinating read that will only raise the respect that we have for  the \"Greatest Generation\", who lived and fought in WWII.', 1, '\"Unbroken\" is, quite simply, the best nonfiction book I\\'ve read in years. I don\\'t generally read \"war books,\" but this is about so much more than combat. It\\'s about the human spirit and an indomitable will to live.Author Laura Hillenbrand kept running across Louis Zamperini\\'s story when she was researching her first book, \"Seabiscuit.\" So eventually, she contacted Zamperini and decided to write his story.And what a story it is: Zamperini, a young bombadier during WWII, survives a plane crash in the Pacific and drifts half-starved for weeks on a rubber raft with two other survivors. When he finally reaches land, it\\'s an island occupied by the Japanese. He is sent to a concentration camp, run by a brutal commander.Warning to the faint of heart: Some of the scenes in the camp are hard to read. The cruelty is difficult to comprehend, and you wonder how anyone survived. But Zamperini does, and returns to the States a hero after the war. He meets the love of his life and marries. But the darkness of his ordeal reaches out to him in nightmares and drinking binges. He is in danger of losing what he holds most dear. Still, he perseveres. In the end, his life is a victory. As of this writing, he is still alive in his 90s.Zamperini and Seabiscuit have a lot in common -- both went through some tough times but never gave up. Both are an inspiration. I highly recommend this book -- and \"Seabiscuit\" as well, for that matter.', 1, '\"Unbroken\" was a fascinating read, the story of Louie Zamperini, a promising Olympian, who wound up as a POW in Japan during World War II. \"Unbroken\" is a true testament about the endurance and character of a person.\"Unbroken\" will make you laugh, make you angry and also make you cry...truly a worthwhile read! Looking forward to reading Ms. Hillebrand\\'s 3rd book!', 1, '\"Unbroken\" was an amazing book.  To realize all that the POW\\'s of WWII went through at the hands of the Japanese, and survived is unbeliveable.  Louie suffered many hardships, but in the end, his faith in God brought him through to a better life to serve others.', 1, '\"Unbroken\" was so much more than I had expected. A compelling story of an amazing man caught up in amazing times and told so graphically by a wonderful narrative writer. A truly great collaberation of a subject and his biographer. I read it on my Kindle Fire but bought the hard back for a friend because I enjoyed it so much.', 1, '\"Unbroken\", by Laura Hillenbrand, is, perhaps one of the most epic survival stories ever told.  Sagas like the life of Louis Zamperini are few and far between - this one is, likely, singular in scope as it comprises multiple instances of survival any one of which would be amazing in itself.  Today, if you mentioned the name Zamperini, virtually no one would know who, or what,  you were referring to.  Ms. Hillenbrand knew she had to rectify that...delivering \"Unbroken\" after seven years of meticulous research which, amazingly, included being able to receive a first-hand accounts (over 70 interview sessions) from a still hale and hardy 90+ year old Louis Zamperini himself.  If anyone believed the author could not top her first book, \"Unbroken\" cements her ability to expose profound and worthy subject matter in an engaging and heartwarming way.Louie Zamperini\\'s life began as the second child of four children raised by Anthony and Louise Zamperini.  Besides his indomitable father and scrappy mother there was Pete, his older brother, and two sisters.  The family was the big-loving close-knit hard working Italian type settling in Torrance California.  We learn right away that being Italian, and without wealth meant discrimination in California, discrimination to the point certain neighborhoods \"encouraged\" The Zamperinis to live elsewhere.  Perhaps, being an outsider (Louie didn\\'t even speak English when the Zamperinis settled in California) hit Louie in a way where he gravitated into a pattern of escalating juvenile delinquency?  Louie grew to be a notorious thief and brawler as he headed toward flunking out of school.  Pete, however, was the quintessential \"good kid\" as well as fine athlete who believed since Louis was fleet on his feet (a successful young thief as to getaway quick) he just might be a runner.  Pete introduced him to Torrance High\\'s track program hoping for the best.  It was an instant life changer, literally enabling Louis to turn his life around - in the process he became a U.S. record-breaking miler, resulting in a scholarship to USC.  This led to Louis being an Olympic athlete at the infamous 1936 Berlin World Olympics!  It would seem Louis had survived his youth\\'s criminal tendencies and, as a young man, was poised for a bright future.  While training for the 1940 Olympic Games the world began its precipitous slide toward a Second World War.  As a result, the Olympic Games were cancelled and Louis decided he wanted to be an Air Force pilot.  Things did not work out initially, but when the U.S. was forced into WWII Louis settled into a support role as a bombardier.  So ends his first survival experience from a life of crime to a successful athlete to a soldier.As a crew member of a B-24 Liberator it became apparent that Louis did, in fact, have a knack for survival when he lived through his plane being riddled with machine gun fire and flak on an early mission.  One crew member of that mission did die as a result of injuries sustained.  That good fortune changed, however, when the remaining crew was asked to participate in the search effort for a lost plane.  Flying in a replacement plane, the \"Green Hornet\" (which no one wanted to pilot due to its mysterious erratic aerodynamic nature as well as being cannibalized for parts) the entire crew never reached their destination and were, eventually, declared dead.  Miraculously, Louis survived along with two fellow crew members.  For a second time, living through deadly air battles and a Pacific Ocean crash landing, Louie proved to beat the odds.On occasion, a person survives an initial incident only to face an almost certain later demise.  With minimal life support would the remaining crew be found in the Pacific before dehydration and other perils took their toll?  This is where the story passes from the point where if I revealed anymore I would deprive you of great pleasure.  If you are at all interested now, all I can say is the level of intensity and downright amazement will keep you riveted and you\\'ll have no choice other than to trade sleep in lieu of finishing this book.  You\\'ll gladly walk around like a zombie because \"Unbroken\" is, IMHO, one of the greatest human survival sagas ever.  This book is wholly beautiful as it horrifies yet, ultimately, uplifts.  This is a fantastic book.', 1, '\"Unbroken,\" by Lauren Hillenbrand, is the inspirational story of a courageous and resilient man, Louis Silvie Zamperini who, after flying a series of dangerous missions during World War II, spent over forty days stranded in the Pacific Ocean on a life raft with two of his buddies.  They were scorched by the sun, buffeted by storms, and subsisted on a minuscule amount of food and water.  Subsequently, Zamperini was captured and interned in a series of brutal Japanese POW camps where he was treated mercilessly by his sadistic captors.  Miraculously, he emerged, battered and emaciated, but still alive.  Little did he know that some of his biggest battles still lay ahead.This work of non-fiction, told in five parts, is more than a biography.  It is a depiction of an era when fighting took precedence over family, vocation, and education.  The sacrifices made by \"the greatest generation\" were incalculable.  Louie Zamperini, an enormously talented track star, had dreams of winning an Olympic medal.  However, this son of Italian immigrants had to give up his promising future of athletic glory.  Louis was drafted and became a bombardier in the air corps.  He and his fellow airmen flew the B-24, known as the Flying Coffin because of its excessive weight, mechanical defects, and lack of maneuverability.  The author provides shocking statistics about the number of fliers who died during training accidents because of faulty aircraft.  \"In 1943 in the Pacific Ocean Areas Theater...for every plane lost in combat, some six planes were lost in accidents.\"  A staggering \"35,946 personnel died in non-battle situations.\"Hillenbrand covers a great deal of territory.  She places us in airplanes alongside the fighter pilots who are being attacked by the enemy; on the ocean with three marooned men who are starving, dehydrated, hallucinating, and on the verge of being devoured by hungry sharks; and in the prisoner of war camps, where a psychotic Japanese corporal, known as Bird, repeatedly unleashes his insane aggression on Louie.  Bird, and others like him, beat, humiliate, and starve their American captives who are, according to international law, supposed to be treated humanely.This book is a marvel of research.  The author conducted countless interviews and consulted reams of documents, all of which she cites in her extensive endnotes.  Some will find that the most harrowing part of the book is how close Louie came to self-destruction after the war was over.  His experiences left him prone to nightmares, feelings of deep-seated rage, and alcoholism.  Louie had to find a way to rebuild his shattered life.\"Unbroken\" is not for everyone.  Hillenbrand spends a great deal of time depicting grisly details about excruciating subjects.  In addition, the book is a bit too long, and could have been edited with no loss of coherence.  Still, anyone who is unfamiliar with the travails of those who left family and friends behind to serve in the Second World War will find this book both enlightening and wrenching.  \"Unbroken\" is not just a disheartening depiction of man\\'s inhumanity to man.  It is also a testament to the indomitable power of the human spirit to overcome even the most daunting challenges.', 1, '\"Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience and Redemption\" is a biography on the life of Louie Zamperini. This book is 496 pages in length and contains 2 maps of the Pacific ocean that show the islands mentioned in the book.SYNOPSIS:Louie Zamperini was the child of Italian imigrants. He lead a trouble youth in the early 1930\\'s until he found his one true talent...for running. He was good enough to compete in the 1936 Olympics in Berlin and was grooming for the 1940 Olympics when WW II broke out. He joined the air-force and was stationed in the pacific theater where he was  captured by the Japanese after his plane crashed and was eventually transferred to Japan. From his time of capture  he suffered under the ministrations of several sadistic camp commanders. And although he made it back home after the war, he lived a life of nightmares and increasing depression until he met a young evangelist by the name of Billy Graham...a meeting that changed his life around for the better.IMPRESSIONS:This book might read like any ordinary biography, except for the almost unbelievable tale that it contains.  Quite frankly I was very skeptical about some sections of this story (especially some dealing with encounters with sharks!). I was convinced that the descriptions given, must have been embellished...and yet, when you get to look at the incredibly detailed list of sources and cross references in the \\'Acknowledgments\\'** you begin to realize that the events appear to be true.Hard to imagine anyone living through the tortured existence that Zamperini endured. Just as difficult to believe that I\\'d never heard of this man prior to reading Hillenbrand\\'s book.Conclusion:A true story; the author had 75 different interviews with Louie Zamperini, in forging this work. It is well written, with abundant references to back-up the facts contain herein. It is among other things, a detailed, unsettling account of man\\'s inhumanity to man...and yet some goodness and glimmers of hope shine through its roughest passages.Ray Nicholson**the \\'Acknowledgments\\' section in the back of this book is extensive, giving a list of people and places Laura Hillenbrand talked to and visited, to get the extraordinary descriptions of Louie Zamperini life and what he had to tolerate.Just as extensive are a series of \\'Notes\\' (also in the back) that detail certain other information sources and quotes.', 1, \"&#34; War is Hell&#34; as they say and I can see why they say that. This story is so inspiring as to the faithfulness of Godand to the determination of men to live. After all Louis, had been through He knew when looking back that God had not abandoned him. Man is so very evil and it shows the extent that one will go to hurt and punish another human being just because he thinkshe has the POWER and RIGHT to do so.Is there a moving coming out about this man's life? What a lesson peoplecould learn by watching it. Hope it happens.\", 1, '&#34;Unbroken&#34;  is a fascinating read -- gripping and well told by the author, Laura Hillenbrand.  A must for any fan of history, particularly WWII.', 1, '&#34;Unbroken&#34;  is one of the finest books I have ever read.  It is an extremely well-written account of a man who survived incredible experiences adrift in the Pacific Ocean and in a Japanese prison camp.', 1, \"&#34;Unbroken&#34; by Laura HillenbrandWhat an amazing account of the horrific conditions our men and women have endured while battling for our freedom and protection through these detailed and verified writings of Laura Hillenbrand.  The first couple chapters grabbed my attention to the extent I was unable to lay the book down.  The intensity grew with each chapter from beginning to end to the extent I felt as though I was suffering through their nightmare beside them.  This book caused me to be even more grateful to our volunteers who serve our great country regardless of what it may require of them.  The details exposed between the binders of this book so greatly express why America truly became 'the land of the free and the home of the brave'.\", 1, '&#34;Unbroken&#34; came quickly and in good condition. It was a present for my grandson, a World War Two buff, who enjoyed it.', 1, \"&#34;Unbroken&#34; has shown me just how little I knew and understood of the previously unimaginable sacrifices, and tragedies which took place in the Pacific Theater during World War II.  Hillenbrand has given us a rich, deeply researched account of one American soldier's extraordinary wartime experience.  A somewhat remarkable young athlete went off to war for his country, as did so many young Americans after Pearl Harbor.Tested time and again by the unfeeling rawness of the open sea, and even further, as a &#34;POW&#34;, by the unfortunate but starkly real and unrelenting brutality of his fellow man, American Airman Louis Zamperini persevered.  He survived the war with a savagely beaten and stressed body, but he soon discovered that his spirit and psyche were even more severely wounded and damaged.  Still, unbroken, he emerges a truly extraordinary human being.\", 1, \"&#34;Unbroken&#34; is a terrific book depicting the real-life, astonishing experiences of Louis Zamperini.  Absolutely a page turner.  My kid's tenth grade English teacher required the book for her honor's English class last year and I thought it was a SPLENDID choice.  At this point, everyone in my family  has now read it, along with my book club.  FABULOUS.\", 1, '&#34;Unbroken&#34; is historically enlightening, thought provoking and heartbreaking at the same time. It is difficult to comprehend what our fathers and grandfathers were willing to go through to protect their nation, their honor and their loved ones. It was a righteous generation and I am very, very grateful.', 1, \"&#34;Unbroken&#34; is one man's account of savage mistreatment and the personal struggle to heal. Rich with detail, footnotes and references, it is a superb biography to dig in to the POW experience. Bravo, Laura Hillenbrand!\", 1, \"&#34;Unbroken&#34; may very well be one of the best books I have ever read. That's a very bold statement, but it's true.This is the true Story of Louie Zamperini, who put aside his rebellious schoolboy days when he discovered a great love of (and talent in) running. Louie made it all the way to the Berlin Olympics in 1936, and was destined to go for gold four years later...until World War II happened. His running career on hold, Louie joined the air force and become a bombardier. Surviving a plane crash that killed most of his crew-mates, Louie found himself stranded at sea for weeks on end, with barely any food, water, or hope of rescue. Ultimately rescue did come, and then Louie faced his greatest challenge of all: becoming a POW in a Japanese camp.This is an amazing book for two reasons. One is Louie Zamperini's unbelievable story. I don't understand why this man is not a household name. All of this stuff actually happened to him...it's unreal. The other reason this book is so astounding is because of the author. Laura Hillenbrand is the best narrative storyteller I have ever come across. &#34;Unbroken&#34; is a very intense book, but I couldn't put it down. It's such an incredibly well-written account of a man's truly extraordinary life.I highly recommend this book to everyone. I will never forget this story.\", 1, \"&#34;Unbroken&#34; really lived up to the hype my (gray haired, over 60, male) friends told me when they urged me to buy the book. What? A woman writing a World War II Saga? Yep-- Ms. Hillenbrand is quite an author-- whatever the subject-- racehorses or WWII vets. As Louis, the book's protagonist, put it, &#34;Unbroken&#34; is even better than &#34;Seabiscuit,&#34; because Louis could talk!Once I began to read, I couldn't put &#34;Unbroken&#34; down. Come home from work and read the book. Watch tv and read the book. Watch weekend football games and read the book. Go to bed and read the book. Addictive!\", 1, \"&#34;Unbroken&#34; was Truly an Amazing story.. A must read.. Can't wait for a movie to be made! I give it a 10!\", 1, \"&#34;Unbroken&#34; was a good enough read (although there seems to be plentiful exaggeration of the hero's role as a god) until Louie's release and return to the United States.  I was left with the impression that the author tired of writing and started trying to wrap things up as rapidly--and implausibly--as possible.  To wit--Louie starts drinking heavily then visits Billy Graham's tent twice and then is converted and then gives up all forms of sin including rock and roll and then goes to church and then returns to Japan and then forgives all his captors and then carries the Olympic torch and then lives happily ever after--whew, end of story.I'm not particularly amused to learn that Zamperini was already writing a book on his adventures when this one was written but, however things came to be (and all parties seem happy with the result), this was otherwise a...decent read.\", 1, '&#34;Unbroken&#34; was a riveting book for me. I was an infant during World War II and never realized the brutality of the Japanese with their POWs. This book touched my heart and gave me chills many times as our servicemen were tortured. I read until very late into the night (morning) on two occasions, and had a difficult time putting this book down. It has certainly deepened my great love and respect for our brave people who are in the service of our country!', 1, \"&#34;Unbroken&#34; was the best.  When you are reading at 3:30 a.m. you know it's the best.It had everything, humor, love, hate, fear and all the rest to keep you captured. And best of all it hadGod's love and His touch when needed. Five stars is not enough.\", 1, '&#34;Unbroken&#34;, by Laura Hillenbrand is an excellent book.  Easy and interesting reading that I would recommend to everyone I know.', 1, \"&#34;unmitigatedly  depressing.  Couldn't bring myself to finish it...Kept waiting for the ray of sunshine...and waiting....and waiting....and waiting....and waiting.....for naught...very  disappointed\", 1, \"&#8216;Unbroken&#8217; by Laura Hillenbrand brings an amazing story based on real events that describes the fate of a man who was a member of the Olympic team of his country, and a few years later ended up as a prisoner in World War II camp.Louis Zamperini was a soldier who found himself back in 1943 in an Army Air Forces bomber that crashed into the Pacific Ocean. He was the only survivor of this accident, and although what he went through was hard, the hardest thing was there waiting in front of him.His youth was not ideal, it cannot be said that he was an example with his behavior, which often exceeded the boundaries and even came to the edge of the law &#8211; he stole, broke into the houses, brawled and escaped from his hometown in order to ride with train. However, in some ways it helped him to find out that he was extremely talented in sports, especially running which enabled him to quickly progresses and finally comes to what every athlete is considering the highest honor - representing his country in the Olympics, in his case one that took place in Berlin 1936.And when the Second World War started, Louis like many other young men across America and around the world replaced his freedom with the military life in the struggle against the Axis powers. Survival in the ocean today with top-quality equipment would be a challenge, and we can only imagine how Louis felt in the ocean, far away from anyone and anything, hungry and thirsty, exhausted and surrounded by sharks to which he was supposed to become food.Still he managed to survive this incredible test, but the nightmare was still far from being over &#8211; he was captured by the Japanese and sent to the camp for its brutality comparable to the Nazi ones, and in some ways it was even worse. For Louis even that was not strong enough to break his robust spirit that led him to sport success; he did not give up next three years of his life even in the most difficult days and this book is story of his hope and dreams about freedom, about suffering, about all that seen from today's perspective is difficult to conceive.What is particularly interesting is that the story does not end with his release from the camp, but continues by describing the continuation of his life, which could not become perfect like using magic wand after all he went through.Laura Hillenbrand with &#8216;Unbroken&#8217; managed to once again deliver a powerful piece of non-fiction that speaks about incredible journey of a man who refused to give up, who did not want to surrender, who fought against himself, but finally succeeded.Therefore her book is dedication to the human spirit that can be measured by force with anything, which is sometimes almost impossible to break as was the case with Louis Zamperini. For this reason &#8216;Unbroken&#8217; can certainly be recommended to everyone as a lesson and an inspiration for all the battles, large and small, that we fight every day in our lives.\", 1, \"&#8220;Dignity is as essential to human life as water, food, and oxygen. The stubborn retention of it, even in the face of extreme physical hardship, can hold a man's soul in his body long past the point at which the body should have surrendered it.&#8221;&#8212; From Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and RedemptionThe word &#34;inspiring&#34; comes up a lot in reviews of this book. I read this book during a stressful time in my life: I was just laid off from a job in a battered and weak economy. For me, the layoff was very much like being ditched in the middle of the Pacific Ocean with only a life raft and scant supplies. I could relate to the fear of the unknown future like an endless horizon of empty ocean, the need to keep spirits up and hope alive while thrashing sharks encircle a flimsy craft.Books can come to us at just the right times in our lives&#8212;sometimes they speak to us. This book inspires me.It inspires me to be grateful - The hardships and cruelty endured by Louie Zamperini and Russell Phillips are more than any person should endure. In my life, I have &lt;i>never&lt;/i> experienced this level of hardship and I hope I never will. I am grateful for the happy life I have lived.It inspires me to hope - This book also demonstrates the sheer power of hope. Even at their darkest hours&#8212;when their hope was the sputtering light of a dying candle&#8212;they kept going. They endured. As long as we all have breath, we can hope for a better future.It inspires me to be kinder -  Sometimes we need to be reminded of the cruelties of humankind. Sick and sadistic people do exist and they inflict terrible injuries on the weak and powerless. As I read this book, I found myself smiling at strangers. I held my tongue and checked my anger over trivial misunderstandings. I wanted to somehow counterbalance the meanness in the world.Unbroken is indeed an inspiring book. This is not a book about war and torture. This is a book about dignity, endurance and the power of forgiveness.\", 1, '&#8220;Unbroken&#8221; by Laura Hillenbrand is a fantastic story putting your emotions on a roller coaster of delight and fear for the remarkable Louie Zamperinni. This book tells you Louie&#8217;s life story and his experiences during WW2 and as a Runner in the Olympics. This story is not for the light hearted as it talks about Louie&#8217;s painful and torturous experiences in the Japanese Prisoner Camps. Besides all of the dark experiences, Louie is a most powerful and moving character who never backs down and always has hope no matter how hopeless the situation is. He is deserving of the title of this book, &#8220;Unbroken&#8221;', 1, \"'Unbroken' is the life story of Louis Zamperini, an amazing man who survived a plane crash in World War II that resulted in him spending the remainder of the war as a prisoner of war in Japan.The story begins with Louis as a wild youngster in California. It looks like he will become a career criminal, until his older brother takes charge and helps him turn his life around and become an Olympic runner. Louis is very focused on running, but World War II creeps up and he ends up in the Army Air Force in the Pacific theatre. After many successful but terrifying ventures, Louis and two others survive a plane crash, nearly starve to death on a raft (in fact one of the crash survivors later dies on the raft), and then are picked up by the Japanese who take them as prisoners.I have read many books about WWII in Europe, so reading about the experiences of men who were POWs in Japan was an education for me. They were subjected to unspeakable cruelty and had a terribly high death rate. The men who managed to survive these experiences were haunted later by their memories. The story of how Louis survived is incredible and unforgettable.However, the story doesn't end with the rescue of the POWs in Japan. Returning home, Louis has to rebuild his life and deal with his POW memories and the frustration of not being able to fulfill his Olympic dreams. He begins a downward spiral, similar to his adolescence, but this time his life is turned around by a spiritual awakening. His brother was instrumental in his adolescent turn-around, and this time, his wife is the one who leads him to the point of change. Again, he becomes a survivor and a leader, and uses his experiences and energies to help others.Apart from being a fascinating, nail-biting adventure story, this book also offers great insight into the character of a man who is an incredible survivor. It is story that will remain in your thoughts for a long time.\", 1, \"'Unbroken' is the story of Louis Zamperini by Laura Hillenbrand. Louis (Louie) Zamperini is a person I had never heard about prior to reading this book, and after having read the book am a little ashamed to have not known about his story. A story that all people should be aware of. After the book 'The Band of Brothers' was published and then made into a great tv mini-series, a lot of people became aware of the trails and difficulties of the US soldiers in the European theater of World War II. This book offers a glimpse into the WWII experience of a soldier int he Pacific theater and specifically a POWs experience.Louie grows up in California and is chronically in trouble. Until his brother Peter is able to focus Louie's energies on one thing, it seemed as if his future was headed to trouble. Louie turns into one of the best milers of his age and were it not for WWII, would have competed for a medal in the 1940 Olympics. As the war is being waged, Louie enters the Army Air Corp as a bombadier, and joins a crew on a B-24. The book tells us the struggles of a bomber crew in teh Pacific and the early missions of Louie's crew and squadron.The story takes a sharp turn when during a search mission, Louies plane crashes in the Pacific ocean. The story now focuses on how Louie and two crew mates survive over forty days in a pair of rubber life rafts. Just this portion of Louie's story is beyond description. The isolation, starvation, thirst, and ever constant presence of sharks will freeze most people in their tracks. After survive an unbelievable ordeal in the life raft, the surviving crew members must now survive being POWs in the care of the Japanese.Louie's time as a POW is by far a terrible, heart breaking time. I was constantly amazed at Louie and his fellow POWs ability to survive. The Japanese brought a constant stream of abuse on the POWs including starvation, beatings, slavery, and an attempt to completely break each individual POWs spirits. As I read each account I could not even begin to understand how one makes it through such a nightmare. I won't go any further, for fear of letting too much of the story out. This is a book that everyone should read. It is hard to read in some parts, not from a technical point of view, but from understanding what these brave men under went. Please read this book and start to understand what this generation of people went through to ensure a free and better world.\", 1, '(I only wish I could add more stars) I\\'ve come out of reading this book for a renewed respect for what the \"greatest generation\" went through.  This book not only captures the truly incredible story of Louie (and I feel close enough to him to call him by his first name after reading this!), but the attitudes and attributes of two diametrically opposed worlds(literally and figuratively).  I\\'m not sure anyone could have told the story better, amazing as it is.  Louie, you\\'re now one of my heros, thanks so much for sharing this story with the world, and thanks to Ms. Hillenbrand for capturing it so well, you\\'ve got a new fan.', 1, '** Unbroken was read as the November 2012 selection for our book club. **The story of Louis Zamperini is incredibly heart wrenching and inspiring when you see everything he and his fellow soldiers went through. Hillenbrand has an amazing talent of making you forget that you already know the ending, and those in our book club all got wrapped up in the moment, \"...wondering if Louis would make it out alive!\".Hillenbrand excellently draws each reader through philosophic reflections on Louis\\' experience. An example:\"Dignity is as essential to human life as water, food, and oxygen. The stubborn retention of it, even in the face of extreme physical hardship, can hold a man\\'s soul in his body long past the point at which the body should have surrendered it. The loss of it can carry a man off as surely as thirst, hunger, exposure, and asphyxiation, and with greater cruelty.\"I was particularly shocked by the brutality of the Japanese, which I was quite honestly naive about. History has not been favorable to the Nazis, for good reason, but somehow my high school and university history teachers neglected to cover the war crimes of the Japanese. I will refrain from republishing the atrocities, but needless to say I was shocked at the inhumanity.Our only real criticism, which I feel is worth a star deduction, was that you get very little account of what as going through Louis\\'s head. You get a very straightforward retelling, and you get the occasional glimpse at who he may have missed or how he often thought of the Olympics, but very little about the emotions he felt. I know he became a very religious man later in life and perhaps that has impacted what he is and isn\\'t willing to say about his captors, but I\\'m curious as to how he dealt with these trials in the moment.I recommend Unbroken to anyone looking for a bit of inspirational history', 1, \"***4.5/5***This story is truly incredible. It really serves to open your eyes to the atrocities that the Allied POWs endured during WWII at the hands of the Japanese empire. The story starts off somewhat slow but it gives you a great insight into the hero's life. Then to read first hand accounts of WWII, being stranded at sea, being a prisoner of war, and the life after war, really pulls you into the story leaving you wanting more. This story will have you cheering and gasping all at once. It'll keep you anxious and relieved at the same time. The book is also quite educational, revealing some mind-boggling statistics. This is an eye opening read, would highly recommend to anyone!\", 1, '.  this was a gift baecause i had already read iat and I wanted my brother to have it  a great bool', 1, '. Fast pace, could not put it down! Wonderful story. Well told and very interesting life. Can not believed he lived through this ordeal!!!!!!', 1, \"... then read this book. Hillenbrand has written a carefully researched and gripping true story (well, maybe the hero stretched it a bit in the telling) of courage and forgiveness. She doesn't do what a lot of non-fiction authors do, which is to digress with a lot of information you don't want to know, just because he/she has researched it and by god it goes in the book. Hillenbrand gives enough background, and moves back to the story - the capture and imprisonment of an unusual man by the Japanese army in WWII. It is a war story of great suffering and pain; it informs us of the outer limits of tenacity, and of cruelty. Far from depressing though, it is an uplifting story with humor, pathos, and a great example of the generosity of a human spirit.\", 1, \"... to those who served and suffered as P.O.W.s in WWII.

There were times I wanted to walk away completely but I had to know about the kind of cruelty human beings are capable of and how one extraordinary man survived that experience.In a world where any sane person would have been justified in committing suicide, Zamperini endures.

However  very  lengthy  and overly graphic.Very depressing,covers torture,alcoholisim,spousal abuse and etc.PTSD  would probably  be careful of recommending to others depending upon their reading tastes.', 1, \"1) Plot (5 stars) - Track sensation Louis Zamperini is called to World War Two where his plane crashes into the Pacific and he is taken as a Japanese POW.  Can he survive the 6 weeks in the ocean and then 3 years of torture?  How will he cope if he comes back to normal life?  Will he ever run again and fulfill his dreams and potential?  It is quite a story, especially considering it's a true one, and for the most the author keeps the pace quick.  Though I did notice myself getting a little bit impatient with how long the POW camp sections were, and how short the conclusion and transformation was.2) Characters (3 stars) - Louis is a great character; there is no doubt about that.  But here's the thing: I always felt like I was on the outside looking into to Louis.  I wanted to know what he felt, especially at the end, but all I got was a reporter's distant view.  At times I felt more connected with the folks back home, and even the guards, than the main character.3) Theme (4 stars) - The theme of perseverance, of pushing on and surviving even when life isn't worth living, was inspiring to read, and threw my cushioned wimpy life in stark contrast.  But the other moral of forgiveness and passing your life over to a higher purpose was so glossed over.  That was the culmination, and I felt robbed.  Was she embarrassed to talk of God?  Is that not as cool as describing every detail of a torture?  I don't know.  But I so wanted to get that experience of transformation, and I didn't.4) Voice (4 stars) - Hillenbrand is a good writer.  Her prose is fast and lucid, and she does a wonderful job of pulling out little details to make the larger story seem real.5) Setting (5 stars) - Being a high level sports star before modern money and training ... Floating in an endless ocean without food or water for 6 weeks ...  Sitting in the living hell of a Japanese POW camp, beaten and humiliated every day ...  Coming home to a confusing and shallow life.  All were done so well.6) Overall (4 stars) - Overall, I would recommend this book because Louis lived such a trying and inspirational life, and Hillenbrand takes you through it scene by scene.  But I can't give it 5 stars because I felt too distant from Louis and the ending was so unexplored.\", 1, \"1) Rating: 5 out of 5 stars2) Genre: Non-Fiction/History3) Synopsis: Louis Zamperini has lived more in one life than most men and not all of it was good. Runner, Soldier, and POW.4) Feelings: I have been meaning to read this book for a while now. When a friend strongly recommended it I finally gave in and read it. I am so so so so glad I did. Did you count the so's there? The size of this book was a little intimidating. Don't let it intimidate you. The last 1/4 of the book is references.That being said this book is awesome. Ohh it isn't a light read. There are times where you will revel in the life of Louis and times when you suffer along with Louis. There will be times where you hate people with a blinding hate. There will be times when you feel close to people you have never meet.5) Final recommendation: This is a great read. Louis Zamperini had a tremendous life. I love to recommend books to people but I can't recommend this book high enough. Read it. Seriously read this book if WWII interest you. Or if stories of Heroes interest you. Or if you want to read about one of the most interesting life stories I have ever heard.Ryan James BurtHusband, Father, and Writer[...]\", 1, '1-16-14.
